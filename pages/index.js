            So what is Mail 2?
          </h1>
          <p className="max-w-[600px] text-gray-500 text-lg">
            Mail 2 is a modern solution to the way students communicate with
            peers in other schools by providing a way to send audio notes
            instead of letters.
            <br /> The traditional way of sending mail through letters was slow
            and tiresome because it required you to write all the time and how
            offen and the mailman would come to your school and your peers,
            non-express because texts can only go so far, conversations would
            offen lose track due to long delays and if your school didnt care
            about mail then you would never send mail at all.
            <br /> Mail 2 solves all these problems by making it audio
            based,powered cloud technologies and not dependent on mailmen or
            school administration. messages will be delivered as soon as you
            send them, Senders can create more expressive and meaningful
            messages. Mail 2 does not require that students have phones in
            school or any device as such because our technology build on media
            thats already in schools like call booths

            But how does it work?
          </h1>
          <p className="max-w-[600px] text-gray-500 text-lg">
            As impossible as it might sound its actually quite simple. Mail 2
            connects with the students at school using an interactive voice
            response system (ivr) that can be accessed using the call booths at
            their schools.
            <br /> You have interacted with an ivr when you called customer care
            for any carrier like mtn its the voice the serves you options before
            you can actually speak to the agent.
            <br /> What happens is that the student will call a phone number
            that mail 2 provides the same way they would anyone at the booth but
            this time call will be redirected to an ivr built by mail 2 you can
            test this ivr{' '}

            by joining our group. Once the students connect to this ivr they can
            create and send messages, get notified and listen to new messages.
